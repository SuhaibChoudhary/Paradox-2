//     "[Verse 1]You would not believe your eyes if ten million firefliesLit up the world as I fell asleep'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhereYou'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare[Chorus]I'd like to make myself believeThat planet Earth turns slowlyIt's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep'Cause everything is never as it seems[Verse 2]'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugsAs they tried to teach me how to danceA foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bedA disco ball is just hanging by a thread[Chorus]I'd like to make myself believeThat planet Earth turns slowlyIt's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)[Bridge]Leave my door open just a crack(Please take me away from here)'Cause I feel like such an insomniac(Please take me away from here)Why do I tire of counting sheep(Please take me away from here)When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?[Verse 3]To ten million fireflies, I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyesI got misty eyes as they said farewell (They said farewell)But I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)[Chorus]I'd like to make myself believeThat planet Earth turns slowlyIt's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)I'd like to make myself believeThat planet Earth turns slowlyIt's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)[Outro]I'd like to make myself believeThat planet Earth turns slowlyIt's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleepBecause my dreams are bursting at the seams..."
